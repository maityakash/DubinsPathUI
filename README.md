## Overview üõ∞Ô∏è

### Problem to solve

Which is the shortest path for two given waypoints for a Ground Vehicle according to Dubin's Path ?

### Proposal

Find distance of all the possible paths between two given waypoints and choose the least among them.

### Timeline

* [x] Week 1: Base Level UI to add waypoints on the map.
  * [x] Task 1: Map Image rendering.
  * [x] Task 2: Adding a waypoint when clicked on the map.
  * [x] Task 3: Apply changes on the selected waypoint.
* [x] Week 2: Base Level Dubin's Algorithm implementation.
  * [x] Task 1: Tangent point calcualtion implementation.
  * [x] Task 2: Dynamic updates on the calculation when a waypoint parameter is updated.
* [ ] Week 3: Feedback
